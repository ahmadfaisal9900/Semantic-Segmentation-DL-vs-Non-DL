# Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning and Traditional Computer Vision Techniques for the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD)

This project provides a comparative analysis of different deep learning (DL) and traditional computer vision (CV) techniques applied to the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD). The goal is to explore and benchmark the performance of modern deep learning models alongside traditional CV methods in driving-related tasks.

## Models and Techniques Used (Work in progress)

### Deep Learning (DL) Techniques:
We focus on the following state-of-the-art deep learning models:
- **UNet**
- **Segformer**
- **ResNet**

These models are trained and evaluated on the Indian Driving Dataset for tasks such as image classification and segmentation.

### Traditional Computer Vision (CV) Techniques:
In addition to deep learning models, we also explore several traditional computer vision techniques, including:
- **Histogram-based Methodology**
- **K-Means Thresholding**

These methods are compared against the DL models to assess their performance in handling the same tasks.

## Project Structure

- **DL_Training_Notebooks/**: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for training and evaluating deep learning models (ViT, Segformer, ResNet) on the IDD dataset.
- **Non-DL-Methods/**: This folder contains scripts and notebooks for applying traditional computer vision techniques such as histogram-based methods and K-means thresholding.
